    "Machine learning invariably involves understanding key metrics such as loss and how they change as training progresses. These metrics can help you understand if you're overfitting, for example, or if you're unnecessarily training for too long. You may want to compare these metrics across different training runs to help debug and improve your model.\n",

    "TensorBoard's Time Series Dashboard allows you to visualize these metrics using a simple API with very little effort. This tutorial presents very basic examples to help you learn how to use these APIs with TensorBoard when developing your Keras model. You will learn how to use the Keras TensorBoard callback and TensorFlow Summary APIs to visualize default and custom scalars."
